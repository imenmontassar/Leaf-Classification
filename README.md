# Leaf-Classification
The objective of this project is to classify binary leaf images and extracted features, including, shape, margin and texture to identify 99 species of plants. 
In this project, I used different classification algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, Perceptron. 
We performed hyper-parameters tuning to achieve high performance of algorithms.
