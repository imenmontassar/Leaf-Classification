# Leaf-Classification
The objective of this project is to classify binary leaf images and extracted features, including, shape, margin, and texture to identify 99 species of plants. 
In this project, We used different classification algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, and Perceptron. 
We performed hyper-parameters tuning to achieve high performance of algorithms. 

Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
